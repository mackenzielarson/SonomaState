PROBLEM 3: 
Write a program that takes as input a string w (over the alphabet{a,â€¦,z})and out puts a
regular expression R such that L(R)includes all strings that are at edit- distance 1 from w.
(A string is said to be at edit-distance 1 from w if performing one of the operations listed
below on produces w:(a)replace one letter of s by an arbitrary letter,(b)delete a letter
of s, or (c)insert a new letter in any position of s.For example,dg,dogs,dag have edit distance
1 from dog.But god,dagretc.are not at edit distance 1 from dog.)

  //We want to replace a letter in the string but it cannot match the current letter (we don't want the
  //output the include the original string because the original isn't edit distance 1 away from the original)
  // [^i] means that the regex will include all letters except "i"
  //Example: Dog with the following replace would be "[^d]og | d[^o]g | do[^g]"

    s.erase(s.begin()+i); 
  }
  //Final case, insert a "." at the end of the input string for the last insertion
  //Example: Dog with the following would result in the final insertion case (after last char in string " | dog. "
